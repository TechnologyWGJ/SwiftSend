## SwiftSend is an efficient web transfer tool with the following features:
- SwiftSend allows quick file transfer without the need for a client or account.
- SwiftSend can be configured to automatically delete files after a timeout, effectively preventing attackers from maliciously transferring large files to fill up the server's hard disk.
- Administrators can efficiently manage the service using SwiftSend's configuration file.
- SwiftSend supports file size limitation to prevent insufficient disk space.

## 🔮 Use Cases
### When you want to send a file to a colleague without adding them on a messaging platform, you can upload the file to SwiftSend and share the verification code for easy file transfer.
